```
A method allows you to have a piece of code that your able to call with a command rather than rewriting the code over and over.

```

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello(words)
  puts words
end

hello("Sam I am")

```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end

```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

```
hello_someone("Joe")

```
