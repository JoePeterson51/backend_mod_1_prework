## Day 6 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

```
A class is the description of a category or a type of thing. It is the root of the whole group and everything in the group is a smaller piece of that description.

```
1. What is an attribute of a Class?

An attribute is something that can apply to everything within the class.

```
class = cars
attribute = color, year, weight
```
1. What is behavior of a Class?

```
A behavior of a class is an action/method that applies to the entire class.

class = cars
behavior = accelerate, brake, crash
```
1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```
class  = Dog

attributes = weight, name

behaviors = run, speak
```
1. How do you create an instance of a class?

```
def speak
  puts "#{name} says arf!"
end
```
1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

```
I'm still a bit confused on the difference between "attr_reader" and "attr_accessor" and when to use which one.
```
